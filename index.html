          Sanki means mad as was his character. He does things extremely which
          he loved. Being a student of final year, he fell in love with her
          teacher. Many times, his heart was broken but this time it's sure that
          his heart will break but he felt the love which he never felt before.
          Through this love he was able to express himself fully without any
          fear of heart break. Will he spread the unconditional love which
          everyone longs for or this time he would break like never before and
          never come out of it? This is the story of his unconditional love.

        <p>
          Kiran means ray of light as her character was. She vibrated passion
          every time but, it needed someone extreme like Sanki to observe, find
          and respect that passion of hers. She was pursuing master after
          getting married and had a baby girl. She used to teach Sanki's class.
          Will she understood the love of Sanki? Could she love him back or will
          break his heart like every girl before. This is something which time
          will tell. Let's understand everything of their life through the story
          of Sankiran. This is something I wanted to tell since so long.
